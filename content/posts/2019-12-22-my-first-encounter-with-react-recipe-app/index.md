During my career, I've been in this *Microsoft bubble* and wasn't aware of how the open-source world has progressed so fast. Netlify, Headless CMS, JAMstack and Git to just name a few, I've heard half of these terms but didn't persue to learn and understand what these do and how usefull it can.

In order to help me decide on which JavaScript framework to start with, I've read many blog articles and watched videos comparing **Angular vs React vs Vue**. My conclusion was that Vue was the easiest to grasp for many developers, but React was the most favourited.

I found the best way I learn is when I'm at the job, through heuristic testing, observation and tinkering... plus I didn't want to spend weeks following an online course where it contained 100+ hours of videos.

Watching <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw">Web Dev Simplified</a> on YouTube for months now, and when he mentioned about his new course where you <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/learn-react-today">"Learn React and all its modern features such as hooks and context in **less than a day** with this highly focused React course"</a>, I got very excited, but this excitement didn't last long and I forgot about it.

Couple of months went by and in one of his videos, he mention that there was a sale on his new React course, and I thought: **'It's now or never'**, *(... or perhaps later)*, it was time for me to jump on the wagon and so I bought the course, have set myself a goal to finish it and create a React app before the end of this year.

It took me couple of days going through the course as I wanted to watch couple of the videos a day, play around with code more by my self and truly digest the information properly, but I finally did it and this the result.

## Verdict

Don't procrastinate learning something new and I wish I started this journey sooner. I always kept my skills updated, but I realised now that sometimes you just have to *upgrade*, much like softwares. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I had so much fun doing this course and learned about a lot of new technologies, I'm glad I've done it now and I think it opened a lot of doors for me and helped me to understand how the future of the web space is developing.

My next goal is to create my portfolio on React, more on that soon.
