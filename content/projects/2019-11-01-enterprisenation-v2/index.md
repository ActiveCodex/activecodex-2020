After 18 months since the initial launch, we've gathered a lot of feedback from our members. We've listened and implemented the changes to make the user experience much enjoyable.

Since I worked on the 2018 version, Enterprise Nation have kindly asked me back to support the relaunch of their web-app built on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Portals.

**Role:**
- MS Dynamics 365 Portals / Front-End Developer

**Responsibility:**
- Guide and explain how the data and the web-app work to the developers
- Assising with the build : restyle and re-write some of the web components since the look & data source have changed
