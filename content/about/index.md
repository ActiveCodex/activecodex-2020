Passionate for good user experience and technology, attention to detail, pixel-perfect and have a savvy understanding of UI/UX & SEO principles.

A thinker & driven person with strong analytical skills that I regularly put into practice through heuristic testing and observation of user interfaces.

I like things related to health & fitness & food, technology, documentaries and I always wonder how ~~humans~~ things work.

Whilst continuing to work hard in my hunt for the perfect business idea, I plan to spend my spare time exploring and appreciating the little things that life has to offer.

I constantly wonder where my future will take me, yet would still drop it all for a chance to see the world.
